# User Data Explorer

A [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) data app written in Python to explore user data.

## Overview

The app uses the firebase Python API to read the `users` firestore collection and perform some rudimentary data analysis. Data can be pulled live at any moment or a historically pulled collection dump can be analyzed instead.
